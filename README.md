This is the app I give to my friend.  
her birthday is 2/25, and I update to GitHub on 3/9 because I forgot to update :)  
I wrote some of what I wanted to say in Apple Note, and created a python file to process the text I wrote([link here](https://github.com/haner0834/DataProcessing))  
  
I gave her this app as her birthday gift before her birthday about 3 to 5 days  
This app cannot upload to AppStore(they saied the app is not popular enough), so I need to find another way for her to download the app without AppStore  
The way is that I added her to my app test group and let her download TestFlight, so she can download the app on TestFlight and not AppStore  
  
## App Content  
Because I gave her this before her birthday about 3 to 5 days, so I create a countdown clock to show up how many times left to her birthday  
and when she tap the screen, there'll appear some nonsense on the screen  
When her birthday comes, the envelope will appear on the screen, and I added some animation when envelope is opened  
After envelope was opened, the text that I want to say will appear on the screen one by one.  
This is the envelope below:
