This app was a gift I give to my friend.  
Her birthday is 2/25, and I update to GitHub on 3/9 because I forgot to do that :)  
I wrote what I wanted to say in Apple Note, and created a python file to process the text I wrote([link here](https://github.com/haner0834/DataProcessing))  
  
I gave her this app as her birthday gift earlier than her birthday about 3 to 5 days  
This app cannot upload to AppStore(they said the app is not popular enough), so I need to find another way for her to download the app without AppStore  
The way is that I added her to my app test group and let her download TestFlight, so she can download the app on TestFlight instead of AppStore  
  
## App Content  
Because I gave her this earlier than her birthday about 3 to 5 days, so I created a countdown clock to show up how many days left to her birthday  
and when she taps the screen, there'll appear some nonsense on the screen  
When her birthday comes, the envelope will appear on the screen, and I added some animations when envelope flap was opened  
After envelope was opened, what I want to say will appear on the screen one by one.  
This is the envelope below:

## Postscript(for graduation update)  
Because I’m about to graduate recently, I think I can do some update on this app(some reason is that I actually don’t what to do for her at the last moment in junior high school).  
First, I change the operation method to allows user see more than one content(before the update, they can only see the birthday countdown, and if the birthday has passed, they get an envelope, in that envelope is the greeting for her).  
And, I added a graduation book(a 3D book allows user scroll or tap the button to open the page), CAP countdown, memories with her(contains image, text), and something I want to say to her before our graduation.  
The graduation book will be blocked until the graduation date has passed(6/8/24). Before it, when user tap the book to see the content, it will just show some nonsense on screen such as “Graduation has not passed, what are you expecting to see graduation book before graduate?”.
